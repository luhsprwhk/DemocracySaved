## Content Generation Guidelines

### Scenario Construction

1. Absurd Premises
   - Example: Koala Harris implements snack-based governance
   - Goal: Transform mundane political actions into absurdist spectacles

2. Conflict
   - Example: Koala Harris panics upon seeing FrankenVance
   - Goal: Generate humorous character clashes

3. Fiascos
   - Start simple, escalate rapidly
   - Incorporate misunderstandings and unintended consequences
   - Culminate in over-the-top resolutions

### Dialogue

1. Exaggerated Speech Patterns
   - Koala Harris: Distracted, snack-obsessed
   - The Orange Man: Boastful, grandiose, hyperbolic
   - P.B: Smug superiority, partisan insults, intellectual grandstanding

2. Humor-Driven
   - Aim for punchlines and absurdity escalation
   - Use witty one-liners and playful insults

3. Cultural References
   - Incorporate memes, hashtags, and social media culture

### Character Dynamics

3. Physical Comedy

### Worldbuilding
