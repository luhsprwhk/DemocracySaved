# Blanduck Quackton

## General Description
- **Appearance**: A literal duck head floating in a jar filled with glowing green liquid (similar to Mountain Dew). The jar is attached to mechanical duck legs, allowing limited mobility. Cartoonish features include an oversized beak and unblinking eyes.

- **Signature Trait**: Interrupting important moments with irrelevant Capitol Hill gossip, delivered in a Biden-like speaking style.

## Blanduck's Backstory
- **Resurrection**: Blanduck Quackton was resurrected by Koala Harris's campaign team to boost her poll numbers in the Rust Belt. A lab accident resulted in the fusion of former president Blandon Quackton's consciousness with an actual duck.
